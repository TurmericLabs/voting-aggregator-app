# Voting Aggregator

Voting Aggregator is an Aragon app offering a checkpointed ERC20 token interface that is usable in Aragon Voting applications. Its purpose is to aggregate voting power over multiple sources, such as other checkpointed ERC20 or ERC900 contracts.

Accounts that have stake in any of the underlying sources will be represented by this app, allowing them to forward actions or vote in an attached Voting instance.
